By using the app, you agree to undergo a study for healthier snacking. 

The use of this app is not invasive at all. It is only aiding your own goal to snack healthily by providing measurement and prompting instructions at the time you need them. We are NOT recommending a weight control program. The app will only be used to support the snacking control efforts that you are already individually pursuing. We are NOT providing any dietary, health, or medical advice in any way. 

The data you input in this app will be collected by the server only if you click the “synchronise” button. All recorded data will be locked away and only be used in connection with this research project. When used, all data will be strictly anonymised and will not be linked to you in any way.

You are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason during the study. 

This study has been approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee (Project ID Number: 1213/015). If you have any questions or concerns about the manner in which the study is conducted, please, in the first instance, contact Yitong Huang (yitong.huang.13@ucl.ac.uk), the researcher responsible for the study. If this is unsuccessful, or not appropriate, please contact her supervisor Anne Hsu (anne.hsu@ucl.ac.uk). 

Thank you again for your participation.
